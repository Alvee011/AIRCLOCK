### üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

1.  **Time Data Acquisition**
    -   The application uses the free WorldTimeAPI to fetch accurate time data for all clocks.
    -   On initial load, it fetches the user's timezone via their IP address to set the main clock.
2.  **Efficient Time Updates**
    -   To improve performance and minimize API calls, the app calculates an initial time `offset` between the API server and the user's browser.
    -   This offset allows all clock displays to be updated locally every second without constant network requests.
    -   When loading saved clocks, the data is fetched simultaneously to reduce load times.
3.  **Data Persistence**
    -   All user settings, pinned clocks, notes, and alarms are saved to the browser's `localStorage`.
    -   This ensures your personalized configuration is remembered and restored between visits.
